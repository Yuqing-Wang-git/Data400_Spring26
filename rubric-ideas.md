title: myth of 30 second hook: aim to discovery the impact of 30 second rule in culture, and music/film industry

### **Data Retrieval**

Data from main stream service, for example,**Spotify Web API** for detailed audio features and the **YouTube Data API** for engagement metrics like views and likes, Or TikTok-specific trends, I will utilize datasets that aggregate song "virality" metrics, such as post counts and views.

### **Correct Specification of the Model**

The project will evaluate how song structures (e.g., intro length, time-to-hook) vary between different streaming eras. Additionally, I will develop a **predictive regression model** to determine which specific audio features most strongly correlate with "virality" on TikTok versus "long-term streaming" on Spotify or YouTube. This multi-variable approach allows me to test the hypothesis that payout rules fundamentally influence song composition.

### **Implications for Stakeholders

For **content creators and labels**, this research identifies structural "blueprints" that increase the probability of a song exceeding the 30-second payout threshold. **Platform developers** can use these insights to adjust recommendation algorithms based on how structural changes affect user retention and skip rates. **Industry analysts** will gain a deeper understanding of how economic "pay-per-play" models are shifting the financial value of recorded music.

### **Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications**

This study examines the **ethical risk** of "algorithmic homogenization," where creators may feel forced to prioritize commercial "hooks" over artistic diversity to survive financially. It highlights **legal and fairness debates** regarding current royalty models that may inadvertently disadvantage genres with traditionally longer compositions, such as classical or jazz. Ultimately, the project addresses the **societal impact** of the "attention economy," investigating whether platform rules are permanently altering the way culture is produced and consumed.
