<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="Data_Retrieval_7"></a><strong>Data Retrieval</strong></h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Data from main stream service, for example,<strong>Spotify Web API</strong> for detailed audio features and the <strong>YouTube Data API</strong> for engagement metrics like views and likes, Or TikTok-specific trends, I will utilize datasets that aggregate song “virality” metrics, such as post counts and views.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=11 data-line-end=12 ><a id="Correct_Specification_of_the_Model_11"></a><strong>Correct Specification of the Model</strong></h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">The project will evaluate how song structures (e.g., intro length, time-to-hook) vary between different streaming eras. Additionally, I will develop a <strong>predictive regression model</strong> to determine which specific audio features most strongly correlate with “virality” on TikTok versus “long-term streaming” on Spotify or YouTube. This multi-variable approach allows me to test the hypothesis that payout rules fundamentally influence song composition.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=15 data-line-end=16 ><a id="Implications_for_Stakeholders_15"></a>**Implications for Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">For <strong>content creators and labels</strong>, this research identifies structural “blueprints” that increase the probability of a song exceeding the 30-second payout threshold. <strong>Platform developers</strong> can use these insights to adjust recommendation algorithms based on how structural changes affect user retention and skip rates. <strong>Industry analysts</strong> will gain a deeper understanding of how economic “pay-per-play” models are shifting the financial value of recorded music.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20 ><a id="Ethical_Legal_Societal_Implications_19"></a><strong>Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications</strong></h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">This study examines the <strong>ethical risk</strong> of “algorithmic homogenization,” where creators may feel forced to prioritize commercial “hooks” over artistic diversity to survive financially. It highlights <strong>legal and fairness debates</strong> regarding current royalty models that may inadvertently disadvantage genres with traditionally longer compositions, such as classical or jazz. Ultimately, the project addresses the <strong>societal impact</strong> of the “attention economy,” investigating whether platform rules are permanently altering the way culture is produced and consumed.</p>
